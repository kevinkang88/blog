Hi! 

After the long hours of coding and not showering, I have decided to give blogging one more try after failing to update regularly which ended up with one technical entry last year. LAME!

For those who are wondering, I have created this blog with [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and hosting it through Github Pages. Jekyll is highly customizable, lets you insert code snippets easily, and most of all they are both free & open source.

{% highlight ruby %}
def sup(name)
  puts "YO, #{name}"
end
sup('Kevin')
#=> outputs 'YO, Kevin' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Hopefully, I can keep my promise and keep this up!
